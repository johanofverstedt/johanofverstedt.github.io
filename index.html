        I am a postdoctoral researcher in the PET/MR research group headed by Professor Joel Kullberg and Professor Håkan Ahlström where I am researching topics related to medical image registration and deep image regression. <br>
        My PhD research was in method development for efficient fusion of intensity and spatial information, distance/similarity measures between sets/images, image registration, and machine learning methods.
